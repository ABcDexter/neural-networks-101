** How to teach neural networks (deep learning) to your grandma?

** Requirements

Curiosity - To learn about neural networks.

Patience - It takes time to train networks.


** Ask Questions

- Raise your hands

- Standup

- Throw something

** Quiz

- Formula to convert miles to kilometers?

- Formula to convert celsius to farenheit?

- Formula to convert non-swimmer to swimmer?


** Tacit Knowledge

Difficult to transfer to another person by writing/verbalizing.

Ex: Driving, Swimming



** How tacit knowledge is acquired?

- By practice and learning

** Sytems


- Open Loop Systems
Ex: Flash light in phone

- Closed Loop System
Ex: Auto brightness in phone


** Closed Loop System

- They can contain tacit knowledge.

- They learn things.

- They can preserve learning.



** Why machines need to learn?

- They know only 0 & 1.

- Humans wanted machines to solve complex problems.

- Very hard to write python program to recognise images.


** How to make machines learn?

- Biology inspired design


** Design a system which can learn


** Learning System v1

- Convert miles to kilometers


** Learning System v1

- Single node

- Not enough for real world problems

- Need more nodes

- Average value which satisfies of all input data


** Learning System v2

- Solve linear equations


** Learning System v2

- Multi node

- Classical xor problem

- Need more layers



** Learning System v3

- Digit recogniser


** Learning System v3

- Mutli layer, multi node

- Good enough for real world problems



** Summary

- Learning how neural networks work is easy

- Training neural networks for good accuracy is hard

** The Real Threat of Intelligent Machines

They perform better than humans in may tasks.

They put humans out of slavery.

- Loans
- Image Recognistion
- Fraud Detection
- Receptionist/Customare Care
